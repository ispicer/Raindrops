Raindrop Game

Raindrops fall down the screen with another circle called the "Catcher" at the bottom of the screen.

The Catcher's movement is defined left to right by mouseX.

As Raindrops fall into the catcher, the score is increased. However, for every ten Raindrops caught, it's size is reduced by 1/10.

For every twenty Raindrops caught, the velocity of the Raindrops in the y direction increases by a factor of 1.5.

Once twenty Raindrops hit bottom of the screen, the game is over.
